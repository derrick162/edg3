# 🛠️ EDG3 — Core Lane (features / product)

> Backlog for the **Edg3 Engineer (Core)** session. Governed by the shared
> [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) constitution — read that first (ownership map,
> worktree isolation, merge protocol). Work on branch `core` in
> `C:\Users\Derrick\edg3-core`. Update this changelog in the same commit that
> ships work, and claim files in the constitution's Status Board before touching
> anything in the ⚠️ Shared list. The PM routes new product feedback into the
> backlog below.

## Changelog
- **2026-06-09** — Lane created (renamed from "Builder" → "Core"). Mandate set:
  ship new user-facing features for the Edg3 voice/calendar assistant. Backlog
  below is a **seed** — the PM refines it from user feedback.

---

## Mandate
Ship new **user-facing features** for the Edg3 voice + calendar assistant —
improving the dashboard, briefing, calendar, and onboarding experiences. Move
product value fast while staying inside the Core ownership lane (constitution
§3); hand anything touching auth/secrets/infra to the Security lane.

## How priorities are ranked
By user-visible value shipped per day, inside the Core-owned surface. The PM sets
priority from user feedback.

## Backlog (seed — PM refines from user feedback)
### Now
- [ ] _First feature — set by the PM from user feedback._

### Next (candidate ideas, not yet committed)
- [ ] Dashboard: surface "Recent activity" / what Edge did, so users can see and trust actions.
- [ ] Onboarding: smoother first-run (connect calendar → first briefing) flow.
- [ ] Briefing: richer briefing content / personalization controls.
- [ ] Calendar: better event review & edit UX from the dashboard.

### Later
- [ ] _…_

## Guardrails for this lane
- Stay in the Core-owned files (constitution §3). For `lib/db.ts` schema changes,
  follow the Shared-file protocol (§5).
- New writes that create calendar events must be **idempotency-aware** — coordinate
  with the Security lane so features don't reintroduce duplicate-on-retry bugs.
- Don't weaken any destructive-action confirmation or undo behavior the Security
  lane has shipped.
